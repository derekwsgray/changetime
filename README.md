# ChangeTime - Chrome Extension

Very simple Chrome browser extension made for the purpose of learning how to write one.

Fulfilled a need I had to replace some UTC timestamps with local time in a couple places, e.g. table cells.

## Usage

1. Toggle to enable Developer Mode on the Extensions page in Chrome.
2. Click the "Load unpacked" and choose this project folder.
3. In the toolbar, click the Puzzle Piece icon (Extensions) and Pin "ChangeTime". This should put the click icon on your toolbar.
4. To use, click the Clock icon to convert dates on a loaded page. (It does not run automatically.)
